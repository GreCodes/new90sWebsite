# new90sWebsite

## This is a "just for fun" project I have created. The idea is to continue adding features that resemble the style websites had in the 90s/early 00s.
So, there is this song by Belgian/Spanish singer Belle Perez, playing my head whenever I write code, or whatever everything tech-related I do.

### What I practiced: 

- Adding ~~those annoying JavaScript~~ alerts.
- Formatting text using ~~the sometimes loathed~~ Comic Sans font style.
- Adding a video with rounded corners.
- Adding a button with rounded corners.
- Adding a footer.
