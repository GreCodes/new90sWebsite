# new90sWebsite

## This is a "just for fun" project I have created. The idea is to continue adding features that resemble the style websites had in the 90s/early 00s.
So, there is this song from Belgian/Spanish singer Belle Perez, who plays in my head whenever I write code, or everything tech-related I do. 
### So have a look at this super simple project that made me smile. 

What I practiced: 

- Adding those annoying JavaScript alerts.
- Formatting text using the sometimes loathed at Comic Sans.
- Adding a video with rounded corners.
- Adding a button with rounded corners.
- Adding a footer.
